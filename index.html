  <h1>who am i?</h1>

  <p>my name is bootkat. i'm a person interested in all types of hacking - general pentesting, 
    hardware hacking, bruteforcing and general social engineering. I would call myself a gray-hat hacker 
    as I can do stuff that is in the gray-zone in terms 
    of hacking, but everything I do is with good intentions on my end, if that even matters.
  </p>


  <h1>how am i aiming to make a change?</h1>

  <p>i'm working on a lot of things that are being created to make a change. one of them that is in the works right
    now is called "predleaker". (maybe i need to come up with a better name)
    other projects are on the way, but they're currently secret. look out for updates here or on my github linked below the logo.
  </p>

  <details>
    <summary>what is predleaker?</summary>

  <blockquote><i>predleaker is a project that is going to let any victims of predators to anonymously
    send a team of people any kind of information that they know about them and have them leaked on doxbin, have
    the predators family contacted, notified about their disgusting activities and have them reported to authorities.
    seperate page on predleaker will be soon added to this blog.</i>
